<h1>
    TREVOR PRAY
</h1>
 
<p>Trevor Pray is one of the stories that have an inspiration in South Africa and entire Africa at large. The story draws out themes which relates to the South African culture. Some of the themes discussed are;Tradition and Culture, Religion, Strength of a woman in the society and Determination and Change</p>


 
<p>The story starts with how he was given the name"Noah" which was after his grandfather. He clearly illustrates his grandfather’s behavior of smoking and the character he also had of loving laddies. His grandfather was humorous it is evidenced by how he used to make the laddies in the village laugh whenever they saw him. Furthermore, they later came to realize that he was bipolar and not eccentric. This shows how people in society are quick in judging before the actual discovery. Trevor respects his grandfather regardless of him being bipolar. He refuses to hit him when he asked for a boxing game. His grandfather Temperance lived Meadowlands with his second family. Trevor’s mother was very cautious when it came to eating food at the place whenever they paid a visit. She feared that they might be poisoned. Trevor, on the other hand, believed that he could pray to God to put poison out of the food. This shows how Trevor was religious and lived in faith and God's power</p>


 
<h2>Tradition And Culture</h2>
 
<p>In this society, the story shows how chauvinism was dominant. It is evidenced by how men used to treat their wives. An example being Trevor’s uncle, Dinky, husband to aunty Sibongile. The <i>slogan</i> that was mainly used was that if you cannot beat a woman then you don’t love her. The story describes how Dinky used to bit up his wife Sibongile. Although women were being mistreated by their husbands, they also had their way of punishing them. The punishment was so severe that they used boiled water and dossed them to give them a warning and boiling oil to mean it’s over. Furthermore, women in that society were responsible. This is evidenced by how his grandmother was responsible and his aunts too</p>

<h2>The Power Of A Woman</h2>
<p>Trevor’s grandmother Frances Noah was the family matriarch. She runs the house looked after the children, did the cooking and the cleaning. She had a sharp mind that she could give a family history from the<i> the 1930s </i>. Trevor has a great-grandmother too called Koko. She was very old that she could not see or move. Every morning someone could take her to the fireplace and stay there the whole day till evening where someone could return her back to her room. In Soweto, society was mainly run by women. Men were in prison and some were still fighting for freedom. They would chant and rally during the freedom struggle. As a nation, they recognized the power of women the society although at homes they were expected to obey and be submissive</p>

<h2>RELIGION</h2>

<p>In Soweto, religion filled the void left by absence. Prayer meetings would rotate houses up and down the blocks in the street. These groups were mainly women and children. The prayers were mainly done in the living room of the family’s house. Every Tuesday of the week, prayers were conducted in Trevor’s place. He loved clapping along with the beat and praying too. Her grandmother loved it when he prayed because she believed that his prayers were more powerful because she prayed in English. They thought that Jesus was white speaks English and the Bible is written in English and whenever one prays in English the prayers are answered first. Every woman in the township had something to pray for. Whenever prayers were at Trevor’s house, her grandmother would want him to pray for everyone. She would turn to her and say “Trevor Pray” and he would pray. And he loved it. Her grandmother had convinced her that his prayers got answered </p>

<h2>Determinaton and Change</h2>
<p>Soweto was a prison designed for their oppressors but still, it gave them a sense of self-determination and control. It had an inspirational story that was unique; In America, the dream is to make it out of the ghetto. In Soweto, the dream was to transform the ghetto. For a million people who lived in Soweto, there were no paved roads, minimum electricity, and inadequate sewerage. But when they put one million people in one place they find a way to make a life for themselves. Everybody in the community did things little by little until they built homes and every family in the township was allocated with a land. Over time they would save money and build a brick wall, then a window until a proper house is formed. Sadly, no matter how fancy one made his house, there was one thing that one would aspire to improve; a toilet. In Soweto, there were no toilet papers, no indoor toilets and the outdoors were terrible. The whole thing was uncomfortable.One afternoon Trevor decided to<i>poo</i> in the kitchen.He took advantage of his Great-grandmother’s blindness and did his business. In the evening when everybody came home the secret had to be reveled by Koko and eventually found it in the dustbin. Trevor’s mother being so religious thought that they had been be-witched. Once again they had to call all the women in the neighborhood and the elderly and burned the <i> shit</i>. Everyone sat in a circle and Trevor had to pray and cast out the demon</p>
